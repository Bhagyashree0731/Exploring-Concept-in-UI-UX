        "     - Wireframe is a simple format which shows the basic structure of any app or website. It is basically a sketch of any design in which there are only outlines of buttons, menues, images, and text boxes but no images or facny design in it.\n",

        "\n",
        "      - Wireframe provides a clear idea that how the app will be looking so that will be easy for the designer to provide and understanding to both, the client and the team members.\n",

        "      - Saves time and money by noticing if there is any problem in the stage of wireframing. It helps in reducing time of developement.\n",

        "    - Usability testing is a process in which the real user are asked to use any app, website or prototype to know what exact problem problem they are facing in using it, from this we'll get to know whether the design is user friendly or not.\n",
        "    -Through the problem of usability testing it helps the designer know if the user is facing any problem like not able to understand the steps or having any confusion regarding the design, so that team will solve that problem and make the user experience easy and smooth.\n",
        "    - The main motive of usablity testing is to make the product as simple, comfortable and effective as possible for the user to use.\n",
        "    -Example\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Lets say a company asked the designer to design a mobile app for ticket booking online for movie, While the process was going on the designer or the company asked 10 users to use it and bookn tickets for any movie.\n",
        "     - In the result 6 out of 10 users were not able to find the \"Book now\" button easily as the button is too small to find and user had to take effort to find it and then use it.\n",
        "     - After getting this feedback from the users the design team will work on making that button easily visible like big and on placing the button in such a place of that app where the user can easily access it, after this change user can complete their booking without facing any complications."

        "   - Hierarchy - According to the mindset and goal of the product some things or icons should be noticable at the first place important things should be on the front and a designer should highlight that button to accquire the attention of the user.\n",
        "      - Example - When we open Amazon app the \"buy now\" button looks big and in orange colour so that user put their attention on that and the other text looks small and situated in the button like see details.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Contrast - There should be a generous amount of gap between the background and the text so that all the text will be easy visible.\n",
        "      - Example - In the whatsapp there are both white and green color which are contrast to each other because white is a light color and dark green is dark in color. They used them in such a manner so that we can easily see that.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Alignment - All the elements should be on proper line so that it will look neat and clean to the user. Also alignment provides a professional and organised feel to the app or website.\n",
        "     \n",
        "     - Example - When we write bio in the instagram there we can notice the alignment on the list of name, profile photo, name buttons they all shows to us in our profile page in the leftside.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Consisteny - There should be one type of buttons, colors and fonts all over app or website so that user will not be confused and feels familiar to use the product.\n",
        "  \n",
        "      - Example -  In the facebook there are blue color buttons all over the app, all the fonts are same on every page.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - White space - There should be an empty space between everything so that the screen wont look so clumsy and it give rest to the eyes of user and they can easily use the product.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Example - In the website of apple there as always a white space between every product it looks clean and classy.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Balance - All the element on the screen should be equally adjust whether it's left - right or top - bottom. So that app will look visually appealing.\n",
